## Introduction

Newton's method is used to calculate to which root of a polynomial converges each point of a plane. For Newton's fractals, each root is associated to a colour. For each point of the plane, we look towards which root it converges and we paint it with the associated colour. In this way, we obtain coloured images. In this topic, I tried to create these images. I get into all polynomials, but particularly in those of the form z(^n)-1. With my partner we created a flat version and a raised version of these fractals.
